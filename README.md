# Deciding to be better

Basically, its time to use what I learned my entire life to create a better life. 2012 was a changing point for me. But after that I didn't
really followed a plan. This app will be my personal journey towards the better life.

I will try to include everything I need for every part of the day in it. Habit trackers, routines for starters.
My vision for it is that I will stop going to random news sites, but I will get the news that matters in my app
I will also manage my gtd with it, first time I tried gtd was in 2012, but I failed to get a good system. I will create my own from scratch

And it the process I will learn to program better.
